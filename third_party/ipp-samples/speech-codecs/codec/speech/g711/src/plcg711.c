APPENDIX I. A high quality low-complexity algorithm for packet loss concealment.

Packet Loss Concealment (PLC) algorithms, also known as frame erasure concealment
algorithms, hide transmission losses in an audio system where the input signal is
encoded and packetized at a transmitter, sent over a network, and received at
a receiver that decodes the packet and plays out the output.
